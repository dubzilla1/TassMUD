                                armor family skills are trainable through use and improve with practice.

                                The following armor-related skills are defined in TassMUD's skill
                                records (see 'help skills' for the full list):

                                - Cloth Armor (normal)
                                    Description: Expertise with cloth armor types like robes and
                                        simple garments.

                                    Description: Expertise with no armor, relying on natural
                                        fortitude, agility, and cleverness in battle.

                NOTES
                                - "Shields" is granted as an instant passive proficiency in some
                                    classes; armor family skills are typically trained through use
                                    (see the 'Armor FAMILY SKILLS' section in `skills.yaml` for the
                                    design note: trained through use, max 10% per character level).
                                - Armor and shield proficiencies are checked when equipping items
                                    and when resolving movement/combat encumbrance.
                                - Some classes gain certain armor proficiencies automatically;
                                    others must train them through gameplay.
