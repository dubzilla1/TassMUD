        - Item keywords defined in the template

    DESCRIPTION
        Drops an item from your inventory onto the ground in your current room.
        
        The <item> argument uses the same smart matching as the 'get' command:
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name (e.g., "drop sword" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Item keywords defined in the template

        - Cleaning up corpses after combat (makes targeting easier)
        - Disposing of unwanted items cluttering a room
        - Earning a small amount of XP from junk items
        
        IMPORTANT: Corpses and containers must be EMPTY before they can be
        sacrificed. You must loot all items and gold from a corpse first.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching:
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Name starts with search term
        - Name contains search term
        - Keyword match

    SYNOPSIS
        equip
        equip <item>
        wear <item>

    DESCRIPTION
        With no arguments, displays your current equipment loadout showing
        all equipment slots and what is equipped in each.
        
        With an item argument, equips an item from your inventory to its
        designated equipment slot.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching (same as get/drop):
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name
        - Item keywords
        - Prefix matching
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        Only items of type WEAPON, ARMOR, or SHIELD with a valid slot can be equipped.
        
        WEAPONS equip to your Main Hand. Two-handed weapons (including bows,
        greatswords, and polearms) occupy both your Main Hand and Off Hand.
        
        SHIELDS equip to your Off Hand, providing defensive bonuses.
        
        If you equip a two-handed weapon while holding a shield (or vice versa),
        the existing item will be automatically removed to your inventory.
        
        If the target slot is already occupied, the existing item will be
        automatically removed to your inventory and replaced with the new item.
        
        Equipping items with bonuses (armor, saves) will update your character's
        equipment bonus stats. The system tracks base stats and equipment bonuses
        separately, and combat uses the total (base + bonus).
        
        "wear" is an alias for "equip" with identical behavior.

    EQUIPMENT SLOTS
        Head, Neck, Shoulders, Arms, Hands, Chest, Waist, Legs, Boots, Back,
        Main Hand, Off Hand

        You can specify either:
        - An item name (uses smart matching like get/drop/equip)
        - A slot name directly (e.g., "remove head", "remove main_hand")
        
        The item remains in your inventory after removal and can be
        re-equipped or dropped.
        
        Removing items with bonuses will update your character's equipment
        bonus stats accordingly.
        
        Two-handed weapons occupy both hand slots and will be fully
        unequipped when removing from either hand slot.
        
        "dequip" is an alias for "remove" with identical behavior.

    EQUIPMENT SLOTS

        - Item keywords (e.g., "cure", "healing", "red")
        - Prefix matching

        After quaffing, the potion is consumed and removed from your inventory.
        
        POTION EFFECTS:
        Potions contain stored spells at 100% proficiency. The effect's power
        is determined by the potion's item level, which varies by potion type
        and the specific instance.
        
        Healing potions use Cure spells:
        - Cure Light Wounds: 4d8 + (1 × level) HP
        - Cure Moderate Wounds: 8d8 + (2 × level) HP
        - Cure Serious Wounds: 16d8 + (4 × level) HP
        - Cure Critical Wounds: 32d8 + (8 × level) HP
        
        This command can be used during combat.

        - Prefix matching
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        SPELL CASTING:
        Magical items cast their spells at 100% proficiency, using the item's
        level to determine spell power. No mana is consumed when using an item.
        
        CHARGES:
        Most magical items have limited charges. Each use consumes one charge.
        The remaining charges are shown after each use. Items with -1 charges
        have unlimited uses.
        
        When an item runs out of charges, it cannot be used again but is not
        destroyed. You can still carry or sell it.
        
        This command can be used during combat.

        NOTE: Some NPCs cannot be attacked (shopkeepers, quest givers, etc.)
        and will display a message instead of entering combat.

        calculated as the sum of AC, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will bonuses.
        
        COMPARISON RESULTS:
          "MASSIVE upgrade"       - New item is more than 2x better
          "far superior"          - New item is 50-100% better

          "ever so slightly worse"- New item is 0-5% worse
          "isn't quite as good"   - New item is 5-10% worse
          "a downgrade"           - New item is 10-25% worse
          "far worse"             - New item is 25%+ worse

    NAME
        aggressive - information about aggressive mob behavior

    DESCRIPTION
        Some creatures in the world are AGGRESSIVE and will attack
        players on sight. This topic explains how aggro mobs work.
        
        WHEN AGGRO TRIGGERS:
        
        1. PLAYER ENTERS ROOM WITH AGGRO MOB
           When you move into a room containing an aggressive creature,
           it may attack you immediately! The mob makes an opposed check
           using its level against your level:
           - Higher level mobs are more likely to notice and attack you
           - Higher level players are harder for mobs to ambush
           
        2. AGGRO MOB ENTERS YOUR ROOM
           Wandering aggressive mobs that enter your room will also
           attempt to attack using the same opposed check.
           
        3. COMBAT IN ROOM WITH AGGRO MOB
           If combat starts in a room with an aggressive mob, or if
           an aggro mob enters a room where combat is happening, the
           mob will automatically JOIN the fight - no roll needed!
           It will fight alongside other monsters against players.
        
        AVOIDING AGGRO:
        - Stay in town areas (usually safe)
        - Be higher level than the creatures you encounter
        - Move through dangerous areas quickly
        - Be prepared for combat when exploring new areas
        
        RECOGNIZING AGGRO MOBS:
        You'll see a message like:
            <MobName> snarls and attacks you!
        
        TIPS:
        - Use RECALL to escape to safety
        - Keep your HP high when exploring
        - Set AUTOFLEE as a safety net

    DESCRIPTION
        Attempts to trip your current combat target, knocking them prone

        - Gives melee attackers advantage (easier to hit)
        - Gives ranged attackers disadvantage (harder to hit)
        - Must use the 'stand' command to recover, which requires an

        - At 100% proficiency: 75% aggro reduction
        - Casting generates utility spell aggro for you (200)
        
        This spell is useful for healers and support casters to help
        damage dealers or themselves shed aggro when the tank cannot
        maintain control.

    NAME
        bash - bash an enemy with your shield

    SYNOPSIS
        bash

    DESCRIPTION
        Slam your shield into your opponent, potentially stunning and
        slowing them. A successful bash leaves the target unable to use
        combat skills and limited to a single attack per round.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        - You must know the Bash skill
        - You must be in combat (COMBAT trait)
        - You must have a shield equipped (SHIELD trait)
        - The skill has a 15-second cooldown between uses
        
        MECHANICS:
        - Sacrifices your next attack to attempt the bash
        - Success chance is based on an opposed check (your level vs target)
        - Success chance is improved by your Bash proficiency (0.5x to 1.5x)
        - On success, target is STUNNED (cannot use cooldown skills) and
          SLOWED (limited to 1 attack per round)
        - Effect duration: 1d6 rounds
        
        This skill is particularly effective against enemies that rely on
        special abilities or have multiple attacks per round.

    NAME
        heroic - execute a Heroic Strike

    SYNOPSIS
        heroic
        hs

    DESCRIPTION
        Unleash a devastating attack that guarantees a critical hit dealing
        maximum weapon damage. The fighter's ultimate skill.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        - You must know the Heroic Strike skill
        - You must be in combat (COMBAT trait)
        - Base cooldown: 20 seconds
        
        MECHANICS:
        - Uses an opposed check (your level vs target) modified by proficiency
        - On success: Deals MAXIMUM weapon damage as a CRITICAL HIT
          (e.g., 5d12 weapon = 60 damage × 2 crit = 120 damage)
        - On miss: Cooldown is reduced by 5 seconds for next use
        
        DYNAMIC COOLDOWN:
        - Base cooldown: 20 seconds
        - Each miss reduces the NEXT cooldown by 5 seconds
        - After 4 consecutive misses (0 second cooldown), the attack is
          GUARANTEED to hit, then cooldown resets to 20 seconds
        
        Miss progression:
          0 misses: 20s cooldown, normal hit chance
          1 miss:   15s cooldown
          2 misses: 10s cooldown
          3 misses:  5s cooldown
          4 misses:  0s cooldown, GUARANTEED HIT
        
        This skill rewards persistence - even if you keep missing, you're
        building toward a guaranteed devastating strike.

    NAME
        sneak - toggle silent movement mode

    SYNOPSIS
        sneak

    DESCRIPTION
        Toggle sneaking mode on or off. While sneaking, you move silently
        through the world without drawing attention to yourself.

        - You are still visible to players using 'look' or 'who'
        
        COMBAT:

    NAME
        invisibility - the invisibility system

    DESCRIPTION
        Invisibility is a magical or skill-based effect that hides you
        from the perception of others.
        
        WAYS TO BECOME INVISIBLE:
        - Use the 'hide' command
        - Cast the 'Invisibility' spell (Arcane level 2)
        
        WHAT INVISIBILITY DOES:
        - Hides you from room 'look' displays
        - Removes you from the 'who' list
        - Suppresses your movement messages (arrivals/departures)
        - Prevents aggressive mobs from attacking you on sight
        
        WHAT BREAKS INVISIBILITY:
        - Initiating combat (kill, attack, cast offensive spell)
        - Being attacked by a creature that can see you
        - Using the 'visible' or 'unhide' command
        
        SEE INVISIBILITY:
        Some creatures and spells grant the ability to see invisible
        beings. When you can see invisible:
        - Invisible creatures appear with "(INVIS)" marker
        - You can attack invisible targets normally
        - Aggressive mobs can still try to attack you
        
        The 'See Invisibility' spell (Arcane level 2) grants this ability.

    - "flee"
  body: |
    NAME
        flee - attempt to escape from combat

    SYNOPSIS
        flee

    DESCRIPTION
        Attempt to escape from combat by fleeing to an adjacent room.
        This is an INNATE combat skill known by all characters and creatures
        at 100% proficiency.
        
        MECHANICS:
        Fleeing requires an opposed check against your opponents (using
        the highest level opponent). If successful, you escape to a
        randomly selected adjacent room.
        
        SUCCESS:
        - You move to a random available exit
        - Movement points are deducted normally
        - You are removed from combat
        - Combat continues for remaining combatants (if any)
        - In 1v1 combat, combat ends when you flee
        
        FAILURE:
        - You remain in combat
        - No movement points are deducted
        - You may try again (no cooldown)
        
        EXHAUSTION:
        If you succeed the flee check but lack sufficient movement points
        to enter the destination room, you fall [PRONE] instead of escaping.
        This represents stumbling from exhaustion while trying to flee.
        Combat continues with you still in it.
        
        PRONE STATUS:
        While prone, melee attackers have advantage and ranged attackers
        have disadvantage against you. Use 'stand' to attempt to get up.

  body: |
    NAME
        autoflee - set automatic flee threshold

    SYNOPSIS
        autoflee [PERCENT]

    DESCRIPTION
        View or set your automatic flee threshold. When set to a value
        greater than 0, your character will automatically attempt to flee
        at the end of each combat round if their current HP falls below
        the specified percentage of their maximum HP.
        
        USAGE:
        autoflee        - Display your current autoflee threshold
        autoflee 0      - Disable automatic fleeing
        autoflee 25     - Flee when HP drops below 25%
        autoflee 50     - Flee when HP drops below 50%
        
        MECHANICS:
        The autoflee check occurs at the END of each combat round, after
        all attacks have been resolved. If your HP percentage is less than
        your autoflee threshold, an automatic flee attempt is triggered.
        
        The automatic flee uses the same mechanics as the manual flee
        command - an opposed check is made, and success/failure/exhaustion
        outcomes apply normally.
        
        VALID VALUES:
        0-100 (0 = disabled, 100 = always attempt to flee)
        
        NOTE:
        Mobs can also have autoflee values set in their templates.
        Your autoflee setting is saved and persists across sessions.

    DESCRIPTION
        When your character is killed in combat, the following occurs:
        
        DEATH SEQUENCE:
        1. A corpse container is created in the room where you died
        2. ALL your equipped items are moved into the corpse
        3. ALL your inventory items are moved into the corpse
        4. ALL your gold is moved into the corpse
        5. You lose 250 XP (minimum 0, cannot lose a level)
        6. You are teleported to the Mead-Gaard Inn
        7. You wake up with 1 HP, 0 MP, and 0 MV
        8. You fall asleep from exhaustion
        
        CORPSE RETRIEVAL:
        Your possessions remain in your corpse where you died. You must
        make a "corpse run" - travel back to where you died, find your
        corpse, and retrieve your items using GET commands.
        
        Example:
            get all corpse    - retrieve all items from your corpse
            get <item> corpse - retrieve a specific item
        
        TIPS:
        - Corpses decay over time, so retrieve your items quickly!
        - The Mead-Gaard Inn is a safe place to rest and recover
        - Use SLEEP to recover HP/MP/MV faster, then WAKE when ready
        - Use RECALL as a safety net before exploring dangerous areas

        Default: ENABLED
        
        MECHANICS:
        - Only triggers when a group member INITIATES combat (attacks a mob)
        - You must be in the same room as the group member
        - You will automatically attack the same target
        - Does NOT trigger if you are already in combat
        - Does NOT trigger if you are sitting or sleeping
        
        This setting allows groups to coordinate attacks without each
        member having to manually type 'kill <target>'.

    NAME
        stand - stand up from a non-standing position

    SYNOPSIS
        stand
        wake

    DESCRIPTION
        Stand up from sitting, sleeping, or prone positions.
        
        OUT OF COMBAT:
        When not in combat, standing up is automatic and always succeeds.
        You transition from sitting or sleeping to standing immediately.
        "wake" is an alias that also stands you up.
        
        IN COMBAT (Prone):
        When prone during combat, standing up requires an opposed check
        against your opponents. This is an INNATE combat skill that all
        characters and creatures possess at 100% proficiency.
        
        - SUCCESS: You stand up and remove the [PRONE] status.
          Opponents no longer have advantage/disadvantage against you.
        
        - FAILURE: You remain prone and must try again next round.
        
        IMPORTANT: Regardless of success or failure, attempting to stand
        during combat forfeits ALL of your attacks for that round (including
        any bonus attacks from second_attack, third_attack, or fourth_attack).
        
        There is no cooldown - you may attempt to stand each round.

    PRONE STATUS
        While prone:
        - Melee attackers have [ADVANTAGE] against you (+1 level bonus)
        - Ranged attackers have [DISADVANTAGE] against you (-1 level penalty)
        
        Prone is typically caused by being tripped or knocked down.
