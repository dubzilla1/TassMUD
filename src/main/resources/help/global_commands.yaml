    DESCRIPTION
        Picks up an item from the ground in your current room and adds it to your inventory.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching:
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)

        - Item keywords defined in the template
        - Prefix matching (e.g., "get ir" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        "get all" picks up every item in the room.
        
        "pickup" is an alias for "get" with identical behavior.

        drop all

    DESCRIPTION
        Drops an item from your inventory onto the ground in your current room.
        
        The <item> argument uses the same smart matching as the 'get' command:
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name (e.g., "drop sword" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Item keywords defined in the template
        - Prefix matching (e.g., "drop ir" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        "drop all" drops every non-equipped item in your inventory.
        
        NOTE: You cannot drop items that are currently equipped. You must
        unequip them first before dropping.

    NAME
        equip, wear - view equipment or equip an item from your inventory

    SYNOPSIS
        equip
        equip <item>
        wear <item>

    DESCRIPTION
        With no arguments, displays your current equipment loadout showing
        all equipment slots and what is equipped in each.
        
        With an item argument, equips an item from your inventory to its
        designated equipment slot.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching (same as get/drop):
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name
        - Item keywords
        - Prefix matching
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        Only items of type WEAPON, ARMOR, or SHIELD with a valid slot can be equipped.
        
        WEAPONS equip to your Main Hand. Two-handed weapons (including bows,
        greatswords, and polearms) occupy both your Main Hand and Off Hand.
        
        SHIELDS equip to your Off Hand, providing defensive bonuses.
        
        If you equip a two-handed weapon while holding a shield (or vice versa),
        the existing item will be automatically removed to your inventory.
        
        If the target slot is already occupied, the existing item will be
        automatically removed to your inventory and replaced with the new item.
        
        Equipping items with bonuses (armor, saves) will update your character's
        equipment bonus stats. The system tracks base stats and equipment bonuses
        separately, and combat uses the total (base + bonus).
        
        "wear" is an alias for "equip" with identical behavior.

    EQUIPMENT SLOTS
        Head, Neck, Shoulders, Arms, Hands, Chest, Waist, Legs, Boots, Back,
        Main Hand, Off Hand

    EXAMPLE
        equip

        You can specify either:
        - An item name (uses smart matching like get/drop/equip)
        - A slot name directly (e.g., "remove head", "remove main_hand")
        
        The item remains in your inventory after removal and can be
        re-equipped or dropped.
        
        Removing items with bonuses will update your character's equipment
        bonus stats accordingly.
        
        Two-handed weapons occupy both hand slots and will be fully
        unequipped when removing from either hand slot.
        
        "dequip" is an alias for "remove" with identical behavior.

    EQUIPMENT SLOTS
        head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, chest, waist, legs, boots, back,
        main_hand (or "main"), off_hand (or "off")

    DESCRIPTION

        Only items of type POTION can be quaffed. Attempting to quaff non-potion
        items will fail with an appropriate message.

        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name
        - Item keywords (e.g., "cure", "healing", "red")
        - Prefix matching
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        After quaffing, the potion is consumed and removed from your inventory.
        
        POTION EFFECTS:
        Potions contain stored spells at 100% proficiency. The effect's power
        is determined by the potion's item level, which varies by potion type
        and the specific instance.
        
        Healing potions use Cure spells:
        - Cure Light Wounds: 4d8 + (1 × level) HP
        - Cure Moderate Wounds: 8d8 + (2 × level) HP
        - Cure Serious Wounds: 16d8 + (4 × level) HP
        - Cure Critical Wounds: 32d8 + (8 × level) HP
        
        This command can be used during combat.
        
        "drink" is an alias for "quaff" with identical behavior.

        quaff cure

        For each spell, shows:
        - Spell name
        - Spell level
        - Your proficiency percentage
        
        Spells are sorted by level within each school, then alphabetically.
        
        For a more compact view of spells as part of your full character
        information, use the 'score' command instead.

    NAME
        kill, attack, fight - attack a target and initiate combat

    SYNOPSIS
        kill <target>
        attack <target>
        fight <target>

    DESCRIPTION
        Initiates combat with a mobile (NPC/monster) in your current room.
        
        The <target> argument uses smart matching:
        - Exact name match (case-insensitive)
        - Name starts with your search term
        - Name contains your search term
        - Short description contains your search term
        
        Once combat begins:
        - Combat rounds occur every 2-4 seconds
        - You and your target will automatically exchange attacks
        - Movement commands are restricted during combat
        - Use 'combat' to see the current combat status
        - Use 'flee' to attempt to escape (not yet implemented)
        
        Combat ends when one side has no remaining combatants (all dead
        or fled).
        
        NOTE: Some NPCs cannot be attacked (shopkeepers, quest givers, etc.)
        and will display a message instead of entering combat.
        
        "attack" and "fight" are aliases for "kill" with identical behavior.

        REQUIREMENTS:
        - You must know the Kick skill
        - You must be in combat (COMBAT trait)
        - The skill has a 15-second cooldown between uses
        
        If you attempt to use kick while it's on cooldown, you'll see

    NAME
        bash - bash an enemy with your shield

    SYNOPSIS
        bash

    DESCRIPTION
        Slam your shield into your opponent, potentially stunning and
        slowing them. A successful bash leaves the target unable to use
        combat skills and limited to a single attack per round.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        - You must know the Bash skill
        - You must be in combat (COMBAT trait)
        - You must have a shield equipped (SHIELD trait)
        - The skill has a 15-second cooldown between uses
        
        MECHANICS:
        - Sacrifices your next attack to attempt the bash
        - Success chance is based on an opposed check (your level vs target)
        - Success chance is improved by your Bash proficiency (0.5x to 1.5x)
        - On success, target is STUNNED (cannot use cooldown skills) and
          SLOWED (limited to 1 attack per round)
        - Effect duration: 1d6 rounds
        
        This skill is particularly effective against enemies that rely on
        special abilities or have multiple attacks per round.

    NAME
        heroic - execute a Heroic Strike

    SYNOPSIS
        heroic

    DESCRIPTION
        Channel your inner heroism into a devastating combat stance that
        guarantees critical hits on all attacks for a short duration.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        - You must know the Heroic Strike skill
        - You must be in combat (COMBAT trait)
        - The skill has a 120-second cooldown between uses
        
        MECHANICS:
        - Applies the Heroism effect to yourself
        - While Heroism is active, nearly all attack rolls count as critical hits
          (any roll of 2 or higher on d20)
        - The effect duration is 30 seconds (base), scaled by your proficiency
        - Higher proficiency increases the duration of the Heroism buff
        
        This powerful skill is best saved for challenging encounters or
        when you need to deal maximum damage quickly. The long cooldown
        means you should use it wisely.

        - Effect duration is 1 hour (base), scaled by proficiency

        range while using their staff. The infusion persists until it
        expires, even if you leave combat.

flee:

    - "flee"
  body: |
    NAME
        flee - attempt to escape from combat

    SYNOPSIS
        flee

    DESCRIPTION
        Attempt to escape from combat by fleeing to an adjacent room.
        This is an INNATE combat skill known by all characters and creatures
        at 100% proficiency.
        
        MECHANICS:
        Fleeing requires an opposed check against your opponents (using
        the highest level opponent). If successful, you escape to a
        randomly selected adjacent room.
        
        SUCCESS:
        - You move to a random available exit
        - Movement points are deducted normally
        - You are removed from combat
        - Combat continues for remaining combatants (if any)
        - In 1v1 combat, combat ends when you flee
        
        FAILURE:
        - You remain in combat
        - No movement points are deducted
        - You may try again (no cooldown)
        
        EXHAUSTION:
        If you succeed the flee check but lack sufficient movement points
        to enter the destination room, you fall [PRONE] instead of escaping.
        This represents stumbling from exhaustion while trying to flee.
        Combat continues with you still in it.
        
        PRONE STATUS:
        While prone, melee attackers have advantage and ranged attackers
        have disadvantage against you. Use 'stand' to attempt to get up.

    - "autoflee [PERCENT]"
  body: |
    NAME
        autoflee - set automatic flee threshold

    SYNOPSIS
        autoflee [PERCENT]

    DESCRIPTION
        View or set your automatic flee threshold. When set to a value
        greater than 0, your character will automatically attempt to flee
        at the end of each combat round if their current HP falls below
        the specified percentage of their maximum HP.
        
        USAGE:
        autoflee        - Display your current autoflee threshold
        autoflee 0      - Disable automatic fleeing
        autoflee 25     - Flee when HP drops below 25%
        autoflee 50     - Flee when HP drops below 50%
        
        MECHANICS:
        The autoflee check occurs at the END of each combat round, after
        all attacks have been resolved. If your HP percentage is less than
        your autoflee threshold, an automatic flee attempt is triggered.
        
        The automatic flee uses the same mechanics as the manual flee
        command - an opposed check is made, and success/failure/exhaustion
        outcomes apply normally.
        
        VALID VALUES:
        0-100 (0 = disabled, 100 = always attempt to flee)
        
        NOTE:
        Mobs can also have autoflee values set in their templates.
        Your autoflee setting is saved and persists across sessions.

    NAME
        death - information about dying and corpse runs

    DESCRIPTION
        When your character is killed in combat, the following occurs:
        
        DEATH SEQUENCE:
        1. A corpse container is created in the room where you died
        2. ALL your equipped items are moved into the corpse
        3. ALL your inventory items are moved into the corpse
        4. ALL your gold is moved into the corpse
        5. You lose 250 XP (minimum 0, cannot lose a level)
        6. You are teleported to the Mead-Gaard Inn
        7. You wake up with 1 HP, 0 MP, and 0 MV
        8. You fall asleep from exhaustion
        
        CORPSE RETRIEVAL:
        Your possessions remain in your corpse where you died. You must
        make a "corpse run" - travel back to where you died, find your
        corpse, and retrieve your items using GET commands.
        
        Example:
            get all corpse    - retrieve all items from your corpse
            get <item> corpse - retrieve a specific item
        
        TIPS:
        - Corpses decay over time, so retrieve your items quickly!
        - The Mead-Gaard Inn is a safe place to rest and recover
        - Use SLEEP to recover HP/MP/MV faster, then WAKE when ready
        - Use RECALL as a safety net before exploring dangerous areas

    NAME
        stand - stand up from a non-standing position

    SYNOPSIS
        stand
        wake

    DESCRIPTION
        Stand up from sitting, sleeping, or prone positions.
        
        OUT OF COMBAT:
        When not in combat, standing up is automatic and always succeeds.
        You transition from sitting or sleeping to standing immediately.
        "wake" is an alias that also stands you up.
        
        IN COMBAT (Prone):
        When prone during combat, standing up requires an opposed check
        against your opponents. This is an INNATE combat skill that all
        characters and creatures possess at 100% proficiency.
        
        - SUCCESS: You stand up and remove the [PRONE] status.
          Opponents no longer have advantage/disadvantage against you.
        
        - FAILURE: You remain prone and must try again next round.
        
        IMPORTANT: Regardless of success or failure, attempting to stand
        during combat forfeits ALL of your attacks for that round (including
        any bonus attacks from second_attack, third_attack, or fourth_attack).
        
        There is no cooldown - you may attempt to stand each round.

    PRONE STATUS
        While prone:
        - Melee attackers have [ADVANTAGE] against you (+1 level bonus)
        - Ranged attackers have [DISADVANTAGE] against you (-1 level penalty)
        
        Prone is typically caused by being tripped or knocked down.
