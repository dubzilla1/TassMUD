    DESCRIPTION
        Picks up an item from the ground in your current room and adds it to your inventory.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching:

        - Item keywords defined in the template
        - Prefix matching (e.g., "get ir" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        "get all" picks up every item in the room.
        
        "pickup" is an alias for "get" with identical behavior.

        drop all

    DESCRIPTION
        Drops an item from your inventory onto the ground in your current room.
        
        The <item> argument uses the same smart matching as the 'get' command:
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name (e.g., "drop sword" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Item keywords defined in the template
        - Prefix matching (e.g., "drop ir" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        "drop all" drops every non-equipped item in your inventory.
        
        NOTE: You cannot drop items that are currently equipped. You must
        unequip them first before dropping.

    NAME
        equip, wear - view equipment or equip an item from your inventory

    SYNOPSIS
        equip
        equip <item>
        wear <item>

    DESCRIPTION
        With no arguments, displays your current equipment loadout showing
        all equipment slots and what is equipped in each.
        
        With an item argument, equips an item from your inventory to its
        designated equipment slot.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching (same as get/drop):
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name
        - Item keywords
        - Prefix matching
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        Only items of type WEAPON, ARMOR, or SHIELD with a valid slot can be equipped.
        
        WEAPONS equip to your Main Hand. Two-handed weapons (including bows,
        greatswords, and polearms) occupy both your Main Hand and Off Hand.
        
        SHIELDS equip to your Off Hand, providing defensive bonuses.
        
        If you equip a two-handed weapon while holding a shield (or vice versa),
        the existing item will be automatically removed to your inventory.
        
        If the target slot is already occupied, the existing item will be
        automatically removed to your inventory and replaced with the new item.
        
        Equipping items with bonuses (armor, saves) will update your character's
        equipment bonus stats. The system tracks base stats and equipment bonuses
        separately, and combat uses the total (base + bonus).
        
        "wear" is an alias for "equip" with identical behavior.

    EQUIPMENT SLOTS
        Head, Neck, Shoulders, Arms, Hands, Chest, Waist, Legs, Boots, Back,
        Main Hand, Off Hand

    EXAMPLE
        equip

        equip shield         (equips to off hand)

        - A slot name directly (e.g., "remove head", "remove main_hand")
        
        The item remains in your inventory after removal and can be
        re-equipped or dropped.
        
        Removing items with bonuses will update your character's equipment
        bonus stats accordingly.
        
        Two-handed weapons occupy both hand slots and will be fully
        unequipped when removing from either hand slot.
        
        "dequip" is an alias for "remove" with identical behavior.

        If you attempt to use kick while it's on cooldown, you'll see
        how many seconds remain before you can use it again.
        
        NOTE: Kick damage calculation is not yet fully implemented.

    NAME
        bash - bash an enemy with your shield

    SYNOPSIS
        bash

    DESCRIPTION
        Slam your shield into your opponent, potentially stunning and
        slowing them. A successful bash leaves the target unable to use
        combat skills and limited to a single attack per round.
        
        REQUIREMENTS:
        - You must know the Bash skill
        - You must be in combat (COMBAT trait)
        - You must have a shield equipped (SHIELD trait)
        - The skill has a 15-second cooldown between uses
        
        MECHANICS:
        - Sacrifices your next attack to attempt the bash
        - Success chance is based on an opposed check (your level vs target)
        - Success chance is improved by your Bash proficiency (0.5x to 1.5x)
        - On success, target is STUNNED (cannot use cooldown skills) and
          SLOWED (limited to 1 attack per round)
        - Effect duration: 1d6 rounds
        
        This skill is particularly effective against enemies that rely on
        special abilities or have multiple attacks per round.
