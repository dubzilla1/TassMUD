    DESCRIPTION
        Picks up an item from the ground in your current room and adds it to your inventory.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching:
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name (e.g., "get sword" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Item keywords defined in the template
        - Prefix matching (e.g., "get ir" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        "get all" picks up every item in the room.
        
        "pickup" is an alias for "get" with identical behavior.

        drop all

    DESCRIPTION
        Drops an item from your inventory onto the ground in your current room.
        
        The <item> argument uses the same smart matching as the 'get' command:
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name (e.g., "drop sword" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Item keywords defined in the template
        - Prefix matching (e.g., "drop ir" matches "Iron Sword")
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        "drop all" drops every non-equipped item in your inventory.
        
        NOTE: You cannot drop items that are currently equipped. You must
        unequip them first before dropping.

    SYNOPSIS
        equip
        equip <item>
        wear <item>

    DESCRIPTION
        With no arguments, displays your current equipment loadout showing
        all equipment slots and what is equipped in each.
        
        With an item argument, equips an item from your inventory to its
        designated equipment slot.
        
        The <item> argument uses smart matching (same as get/drop):
        - Exact item name (case-insensitive)
        - Any word in the item name
        - Item keywords
        - Prefix matching
        - Partial match anywhere in name
        
        Only items of type EQUIPMENT with a valid slot can be equipped.
        
        If the target slot is already occupied, the existing item will be
        automatically removed to your inventory and replaced with the new item.
        
        Equipping items with bonuses (armor, saves) will update your character's
        equipment bonus stats. The system tracks base stats and equipment bonuses
        separately, and combat uses the total (base + bonus).
        
        "wear" is an alias for "equip" with identical behavior.

    EQUIPMENT SLOTS

        Left Hand, Right Hand

        You can specify either:

        - A slot name directly (e.g., "remove head", "remove right_hand")
        
        The item remains in your inventory after removal and can be
        re-equipped or dropped.
        
        Removing items with bonuses will update your character's equipment
        bonus stats accordingly.
        
        "dequip" is an alias for "remove" with identical behavior.
