      A huge cloud forms the plateau on which you are now standing. The wind here
      is absolutely quiet and the sun is shining warmly upon you. From under the
      cloud you can hear the faint sounds of Midgaard. Right before you to the
      north lies the grand Mansion of Naris, the residence of the Greater God
      Redferne.

      You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
      light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
      the pleasant feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
      on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
      To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
      shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
      north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
      looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
      this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

      This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
      shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
      dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
      looking leather arm-chairs adorn the center of the library together with
      a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
      hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
      east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
      west wall.

      globe: |
        You see a large world map stretch out on the enormous globe. It has towns
        drawn in every spot available for such. In the middle of the map you can
        spot a large town with the name 'MIDGAARD' written over it. The rest is
        mountains, woods, plains and water.
      midgaard: |
        You see a small speck with woods on the west from it, plains to the east
        from it and mountains to the north from it. To the south from it you can
        see a thin trail lead to a large castle. Finally you notice a rather large
        river pour in from the east and go through Midgaard in the middle.
      chairs: |
        These two chair are exactly alike one another. They look incredibly
        comfortable. They're both made from old leather, and yet they seem so worn
        that they can be nothing but a perfect place for a long needed rest.
      window: |
        These windows are really BIG! They reach from about 20 inches above the
        floor to approximately 10 inches under the ceiling. If you try and
        "look out", you might see what might lie beyond these windows.
      out: |
        The clouds muster and form the ground on which this entire building is set.
        Through the thinnest of the clouds you can just make out MIDGAARD with all
        it's magnificent activity.
      river: |
        You see a large and winding river cut through the landscape, starting at an
        enormous inland lake, it seeps through Midgaard and finally ends up in the
        Grand Sea on the West-coast of the land.

      You are approximately on the middle of the treacherous Chain. One false step
      and death will come and collect you quickly. The chain leads upwards and down.
      No way are you going to descend now ... you've only just begun your climb.
      Besides it could cost you your life.  Look down and you'll see why.

      This place offers a splendid view of the WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE!!! A magnificent
      light shines upon you and the way up through the clouds is opened. Up there
      you can now see the Mansion of Naris, Residence of the Greater God Redferne.
      The chain beneath you seems to evaporate in the mustering clouds that
      surround you by now.
