      This section of the path is slowly being drowned by the nearby swamp to the
      south, which is creeping slowly inland.  Several caved-in buildings sprawl
      here, torn apart both by battle and the elements.

      Briars and marsh plants stick to your boots and clothes, and clouds cover the
      skies above the murky marsh, leaving the path before you dark and sinister.
      You see some disturbances in the marsh, but after a few strangled screams,
      the sounds stop.

      This area is by no means a forest, but for those who dwell in these sparse
      trees it is one.  Occasionally you see a whole humanoid form floating face down
      in the water, but mostly you only find pieces.  You hear a loud bellow in the
      distance.  And feel fear creep into your heart.

      You are standing near a monolith which protrudes some 20 feet from the
      marsh into the air.  Its black obsidian surface shines darkly in the 
      strange, almost unearthly light that enters through the clouds above.

      A murky bog surrounds you.  To the east a black monolith juts forth from the
      ground.  Far to the north lies a huge pool of quicksand.  Snarls can be heard
      echoing as if from a great distance.

      Floating on this boiling lake is not what you would consider an enjoyable 
      experience.  Many a creature bumps the bottom of your boat, and glares 
      at you through unblinking eyes from the waters below.  The southern 
      portion of the lake looks calm and serene compared to this wild place.
