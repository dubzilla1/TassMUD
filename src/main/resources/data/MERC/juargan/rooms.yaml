      A large archway leads north to a dark vault.  An old stench emanates from it,
      as dust seems to continually flow from the old arch.  There is a small tunnel
      that travels east into a darkness.

      Two large stone sarcophagus's lie stagnant in the center of this small tomb.
      The walls are lined with holes that contain many coffers containing, no doubt,
      the remains of some ancient dwarf.
        A great stone door leads to the west, it has many inscriptions upon it.
