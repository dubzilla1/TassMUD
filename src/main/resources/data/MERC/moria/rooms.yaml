      foreboding. This is the cause of no sunset, it is rather the power of evil
      penetrating these quiet hills. Glancing around you notice only a single bird.

      You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
      small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
      towering over you, overwhelming you ...  The small path seems to have second
      thoughts about these hills because it starts winding unnecessarily, turning
      several times around itself.  To the south the hills have a lighter hue of
      dark. To the north however, the hills have become nightblack holes in the
      distant mountains.

      to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
      feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
      carved into the mountain.  You feel you can hear the cry of help from a
      thousand silent voices all coming from an even darker hole in the mountain to
      the north marking the entrance to a cave (or a grave :-).

      over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
      some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
      A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
