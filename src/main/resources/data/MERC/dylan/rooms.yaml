      You find yourself in a lavish office.  The desk is absolutely huge,
      at least ten feet by five feet and made of ebony and inlaid with
      mother of pearl.  A grandfather clock towers over the room,
      mechanically ticking and tocking the hours away.

      You are in the bottom part of a tower.  A draft brings a chill to
      your spine and causes creaks and groans.  Curtains flutter in the
      wind, causing quite a distraction.  When you go to shut the window,
      you see that the window is closed.  An old, wooden staircase leads
      up into darkness.

      The tower creaks and groans, almost as if it were muttering to
      itself.  There are windows displaying a full moon, reigning over
      the night sky.  The room is dark and there is almost a musty odor
      to it.  You are surprised that you can't detect any dust or dirt,
      although there are a couple of cobwebs in the corner.

      You slide down the moisture covered rock, gaining speed as you
      approach the cliff.  Realizing your foolish error, you madly claw
      at the rock, vainly trying to get a precious hold and save your
      worthless hide.  Next time, heed your conscience.
      
      You've fallen, and you can't get up!!!
