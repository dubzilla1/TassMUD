      You are on a mountain path which ascends a steep mountainside.  The trail
      curves around the mountain so that you cannot really see what lies ahead.
      You do sense great power though coming from the area behind the mountain.

      There are a few stone heaps here and there, the tombs of those who did not
      last the arduous journey up the mountain.  Curiously you notice a few
      uncovered bodies which don't seem to have died of exhaustion.  The path curves
      east around the mountain.

      This looks like a normal mountain path, but it is NOT!  This section of the
      path is habitated by a huge (and of course, man-eating) Cyclops.  The path
      makes its final ascent to an overlook.

      This is a stunning vista overlooking a canyon.  There is a sign here that says:
      
      	BEHOLD -- ELEMENTAL CANYON
      
      Fire leaps up from firepits in the western part of the canyon.  The sky looks
      funny, and the air seems hazy to the northwest.  Electricity sparks
      intermittently in the northeast.  To the east you see a strong, magic-looking
      river flowing through the canyon.  Also to the east you spy a cave entrance
      leading into the canyon wall.  The path descends to the north to another
      overlook.

      Various elemental forms wander the floor of the canyon.  Some seem to be
      going about their business, while others seem to have no business at
      all.  In general, it is calm, yet there is always an incessant buzz of
      things going on about. The canyon floor extends north, east, and south.
      To the west a garden is on fire.

      Last you knew, you were walking on the mesa.  Abruptly the path dropped
      from beneath your feet much to quick for you to recover.  Instead of
      plunging to your death, you seemingly miss the ground and begin walking
      on air.  The space to the north and east seems just thin air, but you can
      walk there.  The pathway you came from is to the south.

      You look down and see the ground 100 feet below you.  The wind whispering
      in your ear seems to reassure you that this is fine.  To the north aways
      you spy a portal of sorts.  To the west is more thin air.

      in your ear seems to reassure you that this is fine. There is a portal
      hanging in midair here. It is to the east.  You can float south or west
