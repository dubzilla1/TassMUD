      You are lounging in a quiet cosy parlour, warmed by a gentle magical fire
      which twinkles happily in a warm fireplace.  There are no doors out.  Clearly
      the owner of this room needs none.

      Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
      can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
      menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
      back and go back the way you've come.
        A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

      You have reached the entrance to the high tower of sorcerery. The

      into the storm clouds above.
        A diamond gate is to the north, guarded by a huge golem. The trail

      You are inside the high tower of sorcery. The sight is truly amazing.

      inside than it is on the outside. Young mages walk about, completely
      oblivious to your presence.
        Exits lead north to the common room, west to the dinning room, east to

      You are atop a stairway. The halls here look quite a bit less used than
      those below. Obviously access to these magic filled corridors is limited
      to those of the upper echelon of mages. The walls here emit a faint blue
      magical aura which provides some light.
        The hallway leads west from here and the stairs go down.

      bark of a tree. Spidery writings seem to crawls across the pages, totally
      incomprehensible to your mortal eye. Something seems to be wedged between
      the pages.

      strong it nearly numbs your body.
        The archway lies before you, glowing and pulsing with energy.

      A feeling of tranquility comes over you as you enter the main chamber of
      neutrality. Some artifacts are hung on the walls here, or set on stands.
      The room in general looks both comfortable and official. Probably where the
      master of neutrality holds audience.

      You are in a large study. Shelves filled with many books or arcane
      knowledge are on every wall. A large oaken desk is in the center, with
      many parchments and scrolls on it. The most notable thing in the room is
      a small set of scales, which floats about eye level. In perfect balance,
      the scales are no doubt a sign of the master's neutrality.

      You are in a large hallway, wide enough to accommodate several people
      standing abreast. The floor here is a swirl of multicolored patterns, in
      constant motion.
        A huge black obsidian door blocks the way north, it looks quite sturdy.

      You are at the entrance to the audience chamber of the grand master of
      magic. Beautiful tapestries displaying the ancient masters of lore are on
      the walls, and the floor is covered with a plush multicolored carpet, which
      seems to rustle and move at the touch of your boots.

      You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
      crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
      patterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
      and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
      attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
      from a single enormous emerald.

      You are in a plush dressing room. Fine garments of many styles and some
      outlandish colors hang from a rack suspended in mid air at eye level. The
      only other interesting feature in the room is a large silver mirror on a
      finely crafted gold stand.

      You are in a small cozy looking library. A few well made books sit atop
      shelves which span every wall. A large oaken writing table is in the center
      of the room with odd papers and parchments on it. The illumination here,
      to your surprise is a quite un-magical oil lamp.

      You are in a small chapel designed around a beautifully crafted golden
      altar. Many icons to lesser deities line the room, but it is obvious by one
      glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for the
      worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

      You are in a small dark passage, which would be unremarkable if not for
      the fact that it ends in a blinding blue light to the west. On hooks set
      into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
      leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
      in the event speedy of a evacuation.

      You seem to be floating in a magical energy field, though you cannot see

      sides, completely negating the effects of gravity.
        An imperfection in the uniform blue can be seen overhead, it might be an

      You are in a small, very messy room. An unmade bed is against one wall, and
      books and papers cover every available flat surface. Empty beer cans lie here

      on a desk.
