      This room has blood and grime all over the walls.  You see maggots and other
      insects crawling up them.  The resident is definitely uncivilized.  Half-eaten
      and rotting body parts scatter the floor, each having its own colony of flies,
      worms, and maggots.

      This small cave opens to the north, south, east, and west.  You are
      overcome by the stench and consider turning around.

      The walls are covered with blood (and body parts!?!?).  Plastered on the far
      wall you see what looks like a human arm.  A half-eaten body lies here with
      its chest ripped out.  The predator seems disinterested in it.

        This reminds you of what a baby would do to its formula during dinnertime,
        plastering it on the wall.

      Obviously something REALLY big lives here.  The stench is quite unbearable.
      There are piles and piles of rotten and half-eaten body parts of animals,
      orcs, (and humans?) strewn across the floor.  There is a larger, more
      prominent pile of rotten parts over in a corner.  It seems to have been
      flattened by something.
