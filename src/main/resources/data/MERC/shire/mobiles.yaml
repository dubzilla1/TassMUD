    The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems to
    penetrate through your innermost being.  He is wearing a silvery cloak
    and holding a multi-colored staff.  Although he appears to be older
    than the oldest man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals
    cannot overcome.

    The Ring Keeper is a rather big but short halfling.  His short stature and
    bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue
    light hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although
    usually a halfling of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt
    to take away that which belongs to him.
