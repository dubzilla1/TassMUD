      You stand in a comfortably well-equipped house, a palace by humble halfling
      standards.  On the wall you see a banner which reads "Home Sweet Home".
      A solid oak door to the east leads to a pantry while you see a cozy bedroom
      to the west.

      You stand in the private bedroom of Bag End.  There are two beds to the
      side, neither of which are made.  Portraits of halflings hang on the wall,
      and as you gaze upon them you come to the conclusion that the owner of
      Bag End comes from a long line of distinguished halflings.  A cozy fire
      in the fireplace keeps the room warm and comfortable.

      You are inside the pantry.  Shelves filled with food and drink surround
      you on all sides.  You wonder why a halfling would need so much to eat.
      The presence of something unseen chills you to your bones.  On the floor
      you spy a trapdoor.

      of whomever owns the surrounding lands.  The air is somewhat musty and 
      the smell reminds you of a stable.  As you look around disdainfully, you
      think to yourself that this is more of a shack than a proper residence and
      you long for the urban riches of the Shire proper.

      Other than that, you feel cozy and protected and don't mind staying for a
      bit longer.  All the warmth and good vibes remind you of the days when your
      mother would hold you in her arms and sing you to sleep.  You find yourself
      wanting to cradle all the animals.

      ready to offer you food and drink.  While most of the patrons are halfling

      found your second home in the Green Dragon.  You see a stairway leading

      You are in the shiriff Post which acts as the nucleus for the three shiriffs 
      of the Lower Shire.  As you examine the shiriffs on duty, you come to realize
      that the halflings of the Shire are not to be reckoned with.  You cower with
      awe.  The only exit is to the east.

      You stand inside a rather crudely built halfling hole.  The many passageways
      and winding paths remind you of a rodent's lair.  The air is musty and damp
      and you feel the need for fresh air.
