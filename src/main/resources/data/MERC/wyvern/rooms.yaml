      You are outdoors on a catwalk between the turrets of the eastern and 
      western towers.  There is a 40 foot drop to the north and south.  You have
      a fabulous view of the surrounding countryside, which consists of a bleak
      wilderness.  At the east end of the catwalk is a small opening leading
      inside the eastern turret.  At the western end, a strange mirror-like portal

      You are inside a smallish hut, the home of a family of Centaurs.  The hut
      is sparsely furnished, mostly the trappings of survival.

      You are in the entry foyer of a large hut.  A curtain separates this section
      of the hut from the next section to the west.  To the east is an opening out
      onto the clearing.

      You are in the back of a large hut.  A curtain separates this section from
      the front of the hut to the east.  This room is finely decorated, if
      somewhat primitive.  The decor suggests someone of authority lives here.

      You are on an east-west path through extremely old growths of oak.  The path
      is fairly faint here.  Undergrowth closes in so closely that little can
      be seen in any direction.
