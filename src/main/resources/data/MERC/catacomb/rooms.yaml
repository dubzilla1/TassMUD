      You are almost surprised to see a tunnel leading off to the south
      into utter darkness.  The floorboards above you haven't been moved
      in a long time, yet there is life down here.  A beam of light from
      the opening above you falls upon a message scrawled on the wall here.
      
      The message reads:
           Adventure for the strong yet calculating
           Death for the weak and shallow
           Treasure for the smart and lucky
           Death for the stupid and accursed
      
      An ancient Glyph above the entrance keeps monsters from wandering up
      from the catacombs.

      This part of the catacombs looked roughly hewn and man-made. There is
      a large cross painted on the floor of the tunnel.To the south it seems
      maybe a bit lighter for some odd reason.  To the north a ray of light
      comes in from a hole in the ceiling.
