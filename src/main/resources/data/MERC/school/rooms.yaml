        Welcome to combat training.
        
        The first lesson is knowing whom to fight.  Use the command 'CONSIDER' to
        consider killing a monster.  Avoid fighting monsters that will kill you
        easily.
        
        The second lesson is running away.  There is a monster in the room down.
        He is too strong for you to kill, but he won't kill you.  So go 'DOWN' from
        here, then 'CONSIDER' him, then 'KILL' him.  After a while, type 'FLEE' to
        escape from him.
        
        You can also set your character to flee automatically with the 'WIMPY' command.
        Type 'HELP WIMPY' to find out more about 'WIMPY'.
        
        After you flee, you will be back in this room.  When you are ready to go on
        to the next station, go 'WEST'.

        Welcome to the cage room.  The adepts of mud school have captured some
        monsters for you to kill.  In the four cages are four monsters of various
        types.  Kill them all!
        
        After you kill each monster, get all of the equipment from their corpses
        with the command 'GET ALL CORPSE'.  You can then use the command 'WEAR ALL'
        to wear your newly won equipment.
        
        When you are done with the corpse, 'SACRIFICE CORPSE' to give it to your God.
        God will reward you for this.
        
        Between combat, you may need to rest or sleep to regenerate hit points.
        You can 'REST' to regenerate hit points, or you can 'SLEEP'.  'SLEEP' will
        refresh you faster than 'REST', but you will be less aware of your
        surroundings.
