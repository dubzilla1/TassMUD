      You stand in the archway of a gigantic stone archway. The two
      steel gates have been forced open and have rusted in place. A hollow
      gust of wind blows by you into the deserted, and seemingly destroyed,
      city.

      This is the main reception area of Thalos' city hall. The walls have
      been charred and scored massively and debris is spread from wall to wall.
      A large gaping hole in the west wall allows you to see out to one of
      the city's side streets. Obviously no one will be seeing you through today.
      Hallways lead south and east.

      Here lies the remnants of a fancy office, possibly the mayor's. A few
      withered plants and broken pieces of furniture make this place anything
      but fancy, though. The only thing remaining intact here is a large
      glass cabinet. A long hallway leads west back to the reception area and
      an ivy-covered archway leads south into a private courtyard.

      What a shame that this mass destruction also touched this once
      beautiful place. The temple's garden path has nothing on this garden.
      Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
      thrown through walls. A large marble fountain in the center of the
      courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
      beauty. Above stands the remnants of one of the watchtowers. Archways
      north and west lead back into the city hall.

      a mess. The back wall as been completely knocked down revealing an
      entrance into another building through yet another collapsed wall.
      Between the two buildings are a few blast craters and boulders. An old
      set of wooden steps leads up to a creaking second floor.

      a city here seem much more reasonable). Closer inspection of the water
      yields a dead body floating around in it, skin melted away from months
      of floating in there. The west wall has collapsed revealing another
