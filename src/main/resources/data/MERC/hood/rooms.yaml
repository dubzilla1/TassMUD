      The walls of the alleyway have been spray-painted over many times
      over the years.  One section of graffiti actually looks legible,
      it says:    This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
                  If you are above level 15 please don't expect much fun.
                  If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
      Another section of graffiti says "Raff Rules!"
      There is a boulevard to the east and Wall Road East is to the west.

      This section of town has been overrun by the Troll gang.  Even the
      police stay out of here for fear of being brutalized.  This was once
      a nice lower-middleclass neighborhood, but know the gangs run the
      streets.  All the shops and homes have been boarded up and abandoned.
      An alleyway is to the west and the street continues east.  An over-
      grown lot is to the south.

      Not really a "park" as you and i would think of it but
      it seems queerly peaceful here in comparison to the rest of
      the area.  There seems to be some kind of memorial to the
      great Mongol warrior Khan being crudely constructed here.

      A wrought-iron fence blocks off what used to be an entrance to the
      cemetery here to the north.  The evil just seems too strong to
      to consider entering.  You feel you should stick with the "lesser"
      evils along the road to the east and west.

      The hallway heads back north to the main part of the inn/pub.
      The stairs leading up to the guest rooms here do not seem
