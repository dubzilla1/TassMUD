      You find that you have entered a strange factory. This factory doesn't
      make cars or computers or something - it makes mobs! The sound of
      machinery can be heard in the background; the grinding gears drive you
      crazy! To the north you see the storage area, to the south the
      foreman's office, to the east the entrance hallway, and to the west the
      eastern end of alley.

      This is the place where the foreman makes frequent visits. The smell
      here is very strong and reminds you of bovine excrement! There is a
      shower to the back, and a urinal to the left. On the floor you can
      see stains of a very suspicious nature. The only exit leads north to
      the foreman's office.

      incorrectly or have some defect are placed here before subsequent
