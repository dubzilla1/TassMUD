# Notes:
# - Use these mappings when converting numeric MERC bitvectors (e.g., "4|8|1024")
#   into human-readable flags or into your game's canonical enums.
# - TASSMUD currently stores area-wide SectorType; consider using room-level
#   moveCost overrides when individual room sector differs from its area.
