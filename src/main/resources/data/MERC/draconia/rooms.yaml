      You stand out in a clearing.  Mountains are all around you.  There is a 
      well in the middle of the clearing.  Lying against the well is a sign.  A
      path leads up the mountain.  The small opening is back to the north.

        You peer over the side of the well.  It looks VERY, VERY deep.  It appears

        The sign reads:
                 This is a bottomless pit cleverly disguised as a well.  People have
        fallen in and never been heard from again.  Trust me, you don't want to go 
        down there.

      You are standing at the top of the mountain.  It feels more like the top of
      the world.  To your north lies a huge platinum door.  You hear very pronounced
      grumbling from behind the doors.  It sounds like something huge and hungry.
      But if you don't have the key you don't have to worry because you can't get it.
      If you do have the key I would suggest not going in.  Some believe the Five
      Headed dragon Tiamat was imprisoned here by the gods.  But who believes in 
      fairy tales.  Well, if you're scared, you can always go down the mountain.
