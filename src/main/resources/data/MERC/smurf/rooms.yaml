      You stand at the entrance to a tiny village.  You can see across the whole
      village easily.  Little blue creatures with white hats and boots and little 
      fluffy tails scamper about.  They sing continuously.  The singing is getting
      on your nerves and you have the urge to squash them.

      Delicious smurfberries grow here.  You could probably eat a year's worth of
      smurfberries in one sitting.  Smurfy Road is back to the west.  Another
      smurfberry patch is to the north.

      Another patch of smurfberries is growing here.  The smell is driving your
      nostrils crazy.  It almost, ALMOST, makes you forget all the singing going
      on.  Smurfy Road is to the west, while smurfberry patches are to the north
      and south.

      The northernmost of the smurfberry patches grows here.  It looks just
      as scrumptious as all the rest.  Just take a few; they'll never know.  Smurfy
      Road is to the west.  A smurfberry patch is to the south.

      You rip the roof of the home to get a good look inside.  You see
      many smurfy books.  The print is so small you couldn't even read it
      with a magnifying glass.  I wonder if Brainy Smurf minds if you
      destroy his home?  Smurfy Road is back to the south.

      Hefty is anything but wimpy.  So is his house.  It actually took you a

      Be vewy vewy quiet.  Sleepy Smurf is probably sleeping.  You see so many

      home.  He takes pride in his work.  You could get to know him or just squash
