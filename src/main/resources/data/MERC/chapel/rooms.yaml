      Mostly rubble, this place used to be the shrine of the famous king Crotus,
      who saved the northern regions from being overrun by the goblin hordes of
      100 years ago.  If not for him, Midgaard of course would have eventually been
      conquered as well.  Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he
      turned to the dark ways in his dying years ... and died an evil man.

      Wow!  Although this hallway is quite filthy and dusty, it is noticeably
      different than the rest of the catacombs ... but you don't feel safe yet.
      The walls faintly show ancient detailed etchings in gold and silver of
      ancient rituals ... not all of which seem pleasant.  The hallway continues
      north into the catacombs and further south as long as you can see.
