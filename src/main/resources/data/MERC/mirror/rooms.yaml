      You stand in the archway of a gigantic stone archway. The two
      steel gates look indestructible, yet they are elaborate in engravings.  You can
      hear laughter and good cheer from the other side of these gates.  Obviously, 
      the city is teeming with activity!  There is a small gold plaque on mounted
      on the archway.

      This is a magnificent street, immaculate all over.  The streets are filled
      with people rushing from building to building and a balmy zephyr blows by you.
      The whole city is teeming with activity.  On one side is a beautiful house 
      while on the other is the entrance to a large mansion.  Sounds of people hard
      at work echo within the mansion.  Near the center of town you see a large 
      domed building, magnificent and immense.

      This is the main reception area of Thalos' city hall. The walls have
      been painted in pure white and thick lush carpet line the floor wall to wall.
      A side door on the west wall allows you to go out to one of the city's side 
      streets.  Hallways lead south and east.

      Here lies fancy office, possibly the mayor's. A few green plants
      and pieces of furniture make this place breathtaking.  There is a large
      glass cabinet along the wall. A long hallway leads west back to the
      reception area and an ivy-covered archway leads south into a private

      This is the bath house for the commoners of the city. Hot steamy water 
      wells up from a hole in the floor. Obviously there is a hot spring located 
      under the city (making the decision to put a city here seem much more 
      reasonable). To the west is another room.

      are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left footprints.
      The footprints make a path that looks rather bewildered and is not the kind
      of path to lead to anywhere significant or important but it seems to have
      made up its mind to enter the hills far away north.  A little distance
      further, you lose the trail and decide not to get lost.

      can feel a strange sensation of joy and calm seeping through You, as if great
      burdens have been lifted from Your shoulders. To the south, You glimpse an open
      area through the trees, while paths lead away north and west.

      The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
      appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
      picturing Gods, Giants and peasants.
         Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
      mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
         You notice that this building is quite new.  A small plaque is on this wall.
