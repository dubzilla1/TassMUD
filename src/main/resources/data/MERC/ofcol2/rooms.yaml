      You are in one of the upper chambers of the Golden Citadel.  The decora-
      tions of this place surpass even those of the first floor.  Gold tiles etched
      with platinum cover the floor, walls and the ceiling.  The lights from numerous
      torches reflect from these shimmering planes, giving the illusion that you are
      standing in a gem.  Stairways lead up and down, and the hall leads north.

      You are in one of the top chambers of the Golden Citadel.  The decorations
      of this room looks like a dragon's hoard.  The whole room is carved out of pure
      gold, and gems of all types glitter from the walls, ceiling, even the floor.
      It is obvious that this room was not meant for you to intrude upon.  A stair-

      You are in a vast chamber carved from gold and platinum.  Gems the size of
      a man's fist protrude from the walls, ceiling, and the floor, making your step
      painful.  A vast open sky-light lets fresh air come in from the top.  In the
      center of this chamber, you see a great wealth of coins, and on top of that
      pile of coins, you see a golden dragon squinting at you.  Exits lead to the
      cardinal directions to the anterooms.
