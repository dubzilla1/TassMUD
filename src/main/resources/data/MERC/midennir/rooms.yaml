      You are standing on the plains. This is a vast desolate place where the
      wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you bars its way. However you
      are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
      The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
      anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
      enter the hills far away north.

      You are strolling along a pleasant, shady lane. The road is lined on both
      sides by tall, stately trees which lend the scene with a sense of quiet
      serenity. You can follow the road north or south.

      The roads cross here.  Midgaard is to the west.  To the east, you see the
      stately oaks and poplars of the holy grove.  A wide path leads south through
      the dwarven forest, and another path leads down.  To the north is a very
      desolate trail.

      You stand on the outskirts of a large city - Midgaard; the capital of this
      land. The road leads east into the peace and quiet - and dangers - of the
      forest; and to the west it becomes the main street of the town; surrounded by
      a confusion of shops, bars, and market places.  Another path wanders off to
      the south.

      You are in a light forest. A path leads south, but the passage to the

      The tunnel widens into a large (well, large for goblins) cavern that
      serves as the living quarters for the goblins of Miden'nir.  The bones of
      numbers woodland creatures are strewn about the room, the remanents of a
      recent meal.

      You now stand behind the inn. The smell here is not so pleasant as
      the keeper and his help throw a good deal of garbage here. A couple of
      piles of rubbish are to the west, but you will smell the worse for
      meddling there. As a clean alternative, you can go north or east around
      the inn.
