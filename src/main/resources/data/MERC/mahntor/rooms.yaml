      You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
      block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
      The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
      very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
      into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
      A small sign is posted here.

      You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
      line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
      down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
      that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
      The path winds north and south into darkness.

      The forest path splits here in three directions. Small paths lead to the east,
      north, and south. The trees above leave a gap which allows light to fill the
      intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
      provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
      Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

      You stand at the edge of a dark forest. A path leads north into the forest and
      its deadly darkness and silence. Looking west, you see a path that leads up
      into a foothills region. Standing here on the boundary between light and
      darkness, you feel very vulnerable and alone.

      You walk along a small path leading through a dark forest. No sounds can be
      heard and little light penetrates the canopy of trees above you. The air here
      smells musty and you long for a fresh breath. You see an intersection of paths
      to the west. The path you are on leads south into the darkening woods.

      great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
      of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
      lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
      directions, south and east.

      the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
      through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

      You stand directly before a huge dark cave. The rocks and boulders outside the
      cave are covered with blood stains and all types of broken and shattered bones
      lie around. An unbearable stench comes from within the cave itself. The dark
      cave entrance looms to the east. The hills themselves lead towards the
      north, south, and west.

      The stench is overwhelming. You can hardly breathe as you enter the cave.
      Looking around, you realize that some bizarre and horrible creature uses this
      cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
      rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
      large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
      towards the west.

      life here. It is possible to climb down to the shore here. The hills

      You stand on a barren section of hills that overlook a rocky shoreline. The
      stiff ocean wind has blown the rocks smooth here and you have to lean forward
      a bit to keep your balance. The salty sea air fills your nostrils and you
      notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
      shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are
      standing leads east and west along the shoreline.

      You weave your way through the treacherous swamp. Gas rises all around you and
      a damp mist covers the ground, making it impossible to travel safely, without
      carefully picking your way around obstacles. Large, gnarled trees rise above
      you. Their moss covered branches block out all traces of the sun. The path
      here leads east and west.

      You come upon a bend in the swampy path. The ground here is fairly sturdy,
      as this place is elevated above the rest of the swamp. Looking around, you see
      a dark, mist filled swamp. Small paths lead south and west into the mist.

      You stand just north of the gates to the village. Looking around, you see many
      crude huts and cooking fires. To the north, you see a huge fire pit. Behind 
      it, there appears to be a hut of sorts. Small paths lead east and west among 
      the crude huts. The gates to the south provide an exit from the village.

      You walk through the crude village. Small huts made of wood and thatch
      surround you. Every so often, you can hear grunts and snarls inside the huts.
      The smell here is unbearable. You wonder what type of creature could possibly
      live in such squalor. Small paths lead west and north here.

      This appears to be the clearing the ogres use to assemble. It is quite large
      and has a raised mound in the center that contains a crude throne. The ground
      in front of the throne is quite worn, as if it is sat on quite often. You get
      the impression that this place is a crude sort of auditorium. Small paths lead
      east and south.

      You stand at the edge of a huge firepit. The heat from the burning embers
      makes you sweat as you stand here. Large spits above the pit are empty but
      they appear to be quite large enough to hold hapless adventurers. A large
      lodge is towards the north, while paths lead east, west, and south into the
      village itself.

      You stand at the base of a steep rocky cliff. To the north, a vast arctic
      wasteland stretches out. The snow falls lightly here and the wind is not
      very fierce. You can climb up the rocky cliff or head north into the arctic
      wastes.

      side of these gates. There is also a possibility of climbing down the cliff 
      face.

      spreads out in front of you. The buildings are sturdy, as they appear to be
      made from the very rock of this mountain. Snow falls all around and a fine
      sheet of ice can be seen covering all but the most used walk ways. Small city
      streets lead east and west, while a main road appears to lead south.

      of cobblestone and are quite treacherous. Small homes and businesses along
      the street are closed tight and light from their windows throws eerie shadows
      across the dark street. Small streets lead west and south here.

      You trudge through the snow covered streets. The street itself is made of
      cobblestones and the footing is quite treacherous. To the south, you see what
      appears to be a small tavern. Bright lights shine through the windows. Small
      streets also lead north and east.
      A small sign hangs outside the tavern.

      This appears to be the main square of Mahn-Tor. A huge fountain graces the
      center of the square, but the extreme cold has turned it into an ice
      sculpture. The water has frozen in arcs through the air. Snow and ice covers
      the square and small streets lead east and west. To the north, you see
      the gates to the city. You also notice a small store to the south.

      insulate the room. A huge fireplace lights and warms the room. Outside, you
      hear the roar of the freezing wind. A small door leads north out into the cold.

      You are at the entry hall to the huge keep. The high vaulted ceiling is carved
      from solid stone. Huge stone pillars rise up from the floor to meet the
      ceiling far above. The architecture appears to be dwarven. A huge pair of
      gates stand to the west, protecting the keep from the harsh cold outside. A
      large hall leads east, deeper into the keep.

      takes up almost the entire wall, stretching far above the floor. Sitting upon
      it, you feel small and feeble. It is evident that this throne is more of a
      decoration than anything else. Only the largest of kings could sit upon it.

      This room is full of green. The furniture and all other items show the color
      of nature. The room smells of pine and forest odors. From the items here, it
      appears as though a woodsman of some sorts lives here. A brown door leads east.
