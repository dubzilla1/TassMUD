      You are in the blue room, one of the guest rooms in Dragon's mansion. The
      walls are (surprise!) blue, and the rest of the room is decorated in similar
      shades, producing a very nice, cool effect. There is a large bed and a
      matching set of sofas, easy-chairs and a coffee table. Through the venetian
      blinds in front of the large east window you can see the edge of the grove.

      pulled away from the wide windows, to reveal a nice view towards the grove.

      You are standing in the middle of Dragon's kitchen. Contrary to popular
      belief, He *doesn't* eat virgins, which is amply demonstrated by the large
      variety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of
      tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
      along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
      stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
      than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

      standing forlornly in a corner suggests that this does not happen often.

      This is Dragons' greenhouse. Green light filters in slantwise through the
      plants, giving the room a subtropical ambience. It is not really hot in here,
      though, rather a pleasantly warm temperature. The walls are all windows, except 
      the eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to 
      see out for all the greenery here. There is a set of easy-chairs and a glass
      coffee table. To the south, there is a wide double door out to a sunlit 
      terrace.

        There are many, many beautiful paintings of famous dragons of history and
        literature. There is a big one of Smaug, a group picture of Cuspidorian Toxic
        Dragons, a rather fearsome picture of Norse Chaos incarnate, a grainy black-
        and-white photograph of Vorgulremik the Steel Dragon, a romantic picture of 
        Dalvenjah the Mindijaran and Allan the man become dragon. There are three
        empty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',
        A panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, 
        while a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) 
        fills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great 
        beast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest 
        portrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.
