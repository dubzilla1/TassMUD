      This is the storage room for equipment used by the

      not many miners actually use any equipment.

      You have solved the maze.  You can tell by the last few moves
      that there is no way that a dumb worker could have figured that
      out.  It seems pretty desolate here.  To the south is a bleak room.
      To the north, you see the maze.  There is a sign above the south exit:
      
          Those who enter, plan on a timely death.
          Especially if you're loyal to the queen.
