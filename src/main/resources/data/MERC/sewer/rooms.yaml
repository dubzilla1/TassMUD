      You stand in a small room with a great big opening in the ceiling. From this
      opening there's mud dripping down in large lumps. >YUCK<. You can smell the 
      foul stench of the slimy sediment as you try not to get covered by the 
      falling sludge. To the east there is an entryway leading out from here and 
      it seems absolutely impossible to force the muddy decent.

        The ground here seems a little different from all the other ledges along the
        Abyss. There's a kind of soft soil on this ledge, maybe you should look 
        carefully at this. It seems to be of some interest.
      soil: |
        You can just make out the outline of a trapdoor here in the soil. The earth
        is probably there to conceal a secret entrance. This looks as if it leads down
        into the seemingly solid rock face of the ledge.

        This seems like an exceptionally heavy gate, made of thick iron.

        This VERY old torch looks as if it has burned for ages, yet no traces of 
        the searing flame can be seen on it!

        This looks as if it has been standing here for at least 12 centuries. It's 
        Very worn and cracks in the surface mingle with the cores of mineral that
        penetrates the rock from which these steps are chiselled.
