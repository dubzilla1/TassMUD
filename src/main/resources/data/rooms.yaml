      An old stone marker indicates this was once a trade route. Scattered around

      As an adventurer, you'll collect equipment and items. Type INVENTORY or INV to

      path leads into the woods.

      animal tracks in the soft earth - some small, like rabbits, others larger and
      clawed. The underbrush rustles occasionally with unseen movement.
      
      
      Keep your eyes open! Creatures roam these lands. When you enter a room with

      Butterflies dance on the warm breeze, and a fallen log provides a convenient
      seat. Wooden practice dummies stand at one edge of the clearing, bristling
      with old arrows and sword marks - a training ground for novice warriors.
      
      
      Combat is initiated with KILL <target> or ATTACK <target>. Once in combat,
      you'll automatically attack, but you can also use special abilities. If things

      Almost there! Beyond this forest, the Starter Plains await. This is where you'll

      A well-worn road cuts through the grass here, running roughly north to south.
      This is the main trade route between the northern wilds and the city of
      Midgaard. Wagon ruts show regular traffic, and you spot a merchant's lost
      button glinting in the dirt.
      
      
      Follow this road south to reach the gates of Midgaard.
