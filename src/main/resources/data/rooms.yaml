  - id: 6000
    key: sewer_entrance_central
    name: Central Sewer Shaft
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A vertical shaft leading down into the sewers
    long_desc: >
      A stone-lined shaft opens here, its ladder rungs slick with damp.
      Water drips from the rim and the scent of old refuse drifts up.
      Narrow tunnels run off in several directions below.
    exits:
      up: 3003
      down: 6006

  - id: 6001
    key: sewer_entrance_north
    name: Northern Sewer Drop
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A barred shaft set into the city wall
    long_desc: >
      The iron grill over this shaft has been left slightly ajar. A rusty
      ladder descends into gloom; faint scurrying noises echo from below.
    exits:
      up: 3040
      down: 6007

  - id: 6002
    key: sewer_entrance_south
    name: Granary Sluice
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A maintenance hatch near the granary
    long_desc: >
      A stone hatch set beside the granary's service lane drops into a
      narrow conduit. A trickle of grain-colored slurry flows past here.
    exits:
      up: 3039
      down: 6003

  - id: 6003
    key: sewer_tunnel_01
    name: Sludge Run
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A low tunnel with a shallow flow of sewage
    long_desc: >
      The tunnel is cramped and the water here is ankle to knee deep. Old
      wooden planks bridge the deeper ruts; echoes make it hard to judge
      distances. A narrow side drain leads off to the east.
    exits:
      north: 6002
      south: 6004
      east: 6008

  - id: 6004
    key: sewer_tunnel_02
    name: Echoing Conduit
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A vaulted conduit that carries water more quickly
    long_desc: >
      The vaulted ceiling here is higher and the flow of water stronger.
      Occasional alcoves in the walls suggest maintenance niches or past
      habitation by creatures who prefer darker corners.
    exits:
      north: 6003
      west: 6005

  - id: 6005
    key: sewer_deadend_01
    name: Collapsed Alcove
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A small chamber partly blocked by rubble
    long_desc: >
      Rubble falls from a collapsed ceiling have blocked much of this
      chamber. Small tunnels squeeze around the debris but most lead to
      tight, impassable crawlspaces.
    exits:
      east: 6004

  - id: 6006
    key: sewer_spiral_down
    name: Spiraling Drain
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A spiraling corridor that descends deeper
    long_desc: >
      The passage spirals down along a carved stone helix with trickling
      water running along the edge. The air grows cooler and the stones
      are slicker here; distant pounding suggests a larger chamber below.
    exits:
      up: 6000
      down: 6009

  - id: 6007
    key: sewer_side_tunnel_north
    name: Rat-Scent Passage
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A narrow passage reeking of rodent activity
    long_desc: >
      The floor is carpeted with droppings and the air moves with the
      nervous rustle of many small feet. Scratch marks lead deeper into
      a maze of smaller tunnels.
    exits:
      south: 6008
      west: 6010

  - id: 6008
    key: sewer_crossing
    name: T-junction Beneath Midgaard
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A crossing where several drains meet
    long_desc: >
      Three tunnels converge here; the water is shallow but the noise is
      intense. A narrow iron gate is set into the northern wall and a
      slick ramp leads down to a lower channel.
    exits:
      west: 6003
      north: 6007
      down: 6011

  - id: 6009
    key: sewer_lower_hall
    name: Lower Hall of the Sewers
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A broad, dimly lit hall cut into old stone
    long_desc: >
      This larger chamber looks like it was carved long ago to act as a cistern
      or holding pool. Stagnant water reflects faint torchlight from above.
      A narrow tunnel climbs to the west while a carved recess to the east
      looks like it once held offerings or markers.
    exits:
      up: 6006
      west: 6012
      east: 6013

  - id: 6010
    key: sewer_rat_tunnels_entrance
    name: Rat-Tunnel Mouth
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A cramped hole leading into a rat-run network
    long_desc: >
      Jagged stones form a low arch here and a maze of tiny tunnels threads
      away, barely big enough for a hand to pass. The smell of rot is strong.
    exits:
      east: 6007
      south: 6014

  - id: 6011
    key: sewer_down_ramp
    name: Ramp to the Lower Flow
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A slick ramp leading to a lower sewage channel
    long_desc: >
      The ramp slopes into a deeper, faster-moving channel. Chains bolted
      into the wall suggest maintenance crews once tied off equipment here.
    exits:
      up: 6008
      down: 6015

  - id: 6012
    key: sewer_vault_approach
    name: Approaching the Rathold
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: The air grows warmer and smells of old incense
    long_desc: >
      Faint bits of carved bone and detritus hanging from the ceiling give
      this passage an unnerving feeling. The scrawl of some animal's chew
      marks the masonry; this tunnel feels like it leads to a den.
    exits:
      east: 6009
      west: 6016

  - id: 6013
    key: sewer_antechamber
    name: Flooded Antechamber
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A shallow flooded room with shelves of muck
    long_desc: >
      The room is partially filled with water and debris. A short stone
      staircase leads up into a blocked corridor; a narrow vault entrance
      has been hewn into the far wall and sealed with a wooden bar.
    exits:
      west: 6009
      up: 6017

  - id: 6014
    key: sewer_deadend_tunnel
    name: Tunnel Terminus
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A tight terminus that peters out into rubble
    long_desc: >
      The tunnel was once larger but has collapsed; only tiny, dangerous
      passages continue. For now this leads nowhere useful.
    exits:
      north: 6010

  - id: 6015
    key: sewer_deeper_channel
    name: The Deeper Flow
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A strong, fast-moving channel that carries the main flow
    long_desc: >
      Water moves quickly here; only a narrow ledge gives safe passage.
      The sound of rushing water makes conversation difficult. A rusted
      hatch screws into the far wall and might connect to surface drains.
    exits:
      up: 6011
      west: 6018

  - id: 6016
    key: sewer_rathold_mouth
    name: Entrance to the Rat Hold
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A wide opening hemmed with gnawed timber
    long_desc: >
      The roof here is blackened by smoke and the floor is trampled flat.
      Small tokens have been hung like trophies; further in a larger
      chamber exhales cold, stale air.
    exits:
      east: 6012
      west: 6019

  - id: 6017
    key: sewer_maintenance_exit
    name: Maintenance Egress
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A blocked stair leading toward the surface
    long_desc: >
      Stairs climb toward a sealed access hatch; rusted bolts and old rope
      suggest this was used rarely. Someone has cleared partial debris to
      allow a narrow passage upward.
    exits:
      down: 6013

  - id: 6018
    key: sewer_lower_bypass
    name: Subflow Bypass
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A narrow bypass tunnel beside the main channel
    long_desc: >
      This bypass was cut later to divert peak flows. It is narrow and
      requires careful footing to avoid a sudden dip into the main stream.
    exits:
      east: 6015

  - id: 6019
    key: sewer_ratking_throne
    name: Rat King's Hall
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A grotesque throne room of piled refuse
    long_desc: >
      A vast chamber ringed with the bones of smaller creatures centers on
      a throne of scavenged metal and bone. The Rat King---a grotesque
      aggregation of rodents and filth---is said to rule here. A small
      vault with a crude lock sits hidden in a niche to the south.
    exits:
      east: 6016
      south: 6020

  - id: 6020
    key: sewer_ratking_vault
    name: Rat King's Vault
    area_id: 6
    short_desc: A cramped vault tucked behind the throne
    long_desc: >
      The vault is damp and smells of old coin and rust. Crates and small
      broken chests line the walls; for now they hold little of value but
      could be interesting to explore later.
    exits:

    key: encampment
    name: The Encampment
    area_id: 1
    short_desc: A mountain camp with weathered tents
    long_desc: >
      You stand in a small encampment nestled against the mountain's rocky face.
      Weathered canvas tents flutter in the breeze, and a smoldering campfire crackles
      nearby. A grizzled veteran sits on a log, gesturing toward a trail leading south.
      
      
      Welcome, adventurer! This is the beginning of your journey. Type LOOK to examine
      your surroundings at any time. You can also LOOK AT <something> to examine specific
      things - try LOOK AT FIRE or LOOK AT VETERAN.
      
      
      A worn trail leads SOUTH down the mountainside.

    name: Mountain Overlook
    area_id: 1
    short_desc: A rocky ledge with a sweeping view
    long_desc: >
      The trail opens onto a rocky ledge offering a breathtaking view. Far below, golden
      plains stretch toward the horizon, dotted with copses of trees. You can just make
      out the distant spires of a great city catching the morning light.
      
      
      To move around the world, use cardinal directions: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST.
      You can also use shortcuts like N, S, E, and W. The trail continues SOUTH from here,
      while the encampment lies to the NORTH.

    name: Rocky Trail
    area_id: 1
    short_desc: A winding mountain trail
    long_desc: >
      Loose stones shift beneath your feet as the trail winds between massive boulders.
      Someone has painted yellow arrows on the rocks to mark the path. A cold wind
      whistles through gaps in the stone, carrying the scent of pine from below.
      
      
      Navigation is essential for survival. Pay attention to room descriptions - they
      often hint at which directions you can travel. The trail leads NORTH back up the
      mountain and continues SOUTH deeper into the pass.
    exits:

    key: switchback_turn
    name: Switchback Turn
    area_id: 1
    short_desc: A sharp turn in the trail
    long_desc: >
      The trail makes a sharp switchback here, carved into the mountainside by
      countless travelers before you. A weathered signpost stands at the turn,
      its arrows pointing in various directions. Initials and messages have been
      carved into its wooden surface by past adventurers.
      
      
      Some areas have multiple exits. Use EXITS or just EX to see all available
      directions from your current location. From here, the trail leads NORTH
      back uphill and bends EAST to continue descending.

    key: narrow_ledge
    name: Narrow Ledge
    area_id: 1
    short_desc: A precarious mountain ledge
    long_desc: >
      You inch along a narrow ledge with a sheer drop on one side. The view is
      spectacular but dizzying. Ancient iron rings have been hammered into the
      cliff face - perhaps for safety ropes in worse weather. Your muscles tense
      with every careful step.
      
      
      Your character has various attributes that affect their abilities. Type STATS
      or SCORE to see your current statistics, including Strength, Dexterity, and
      your health points. Keeping track of your HP is vital for survival!
      
      
      The ledge continues EAST, while the wider trail lies to the WEST.

    name: Waystone Rest
    area_id: 1
    short_desc: A sheltered resting spot
    long_desc: >
      A large flat boulder provides a welcome resting spot here, sheltered from the
      wind by an overhanging cliff. An ancient waystone stands nearby, its surface
      covered in worn runes. Someone has left a small offering of dried flowers at
      its base.
      
      
      If you're ever unsure what to do, type HELP to see a list of available topics.
      You can also type HELP <command> for detailed information about specific commands.
      Try HELP COMBAT or HELP NAVIGATION to learn more.
      
      
      The path continues SOUTH from here, or you can return WEST along the ledge.

    name: Mountain Base
    area_id: 1
    short_desc: Where the mountains meet the foothills
    long_desc: >
      The steep trail finally levels out as you reach the base of the mountains.
      The air is warmer here, and the harsh rocks give way to grassy hillocks.
      An old stone marker indicates this was once a trade route. Scattered around
      are remnants of an abandoned supply cache.
      
      
      As an adventurer, you'll collect equipment and items. Type INVENTORY or INV to
      see what you're carrying. Use EQUIPMENT or EQ to see what you have equipped.
      You can WEAR armor, WIELD weapons, and REMOVE items you no longer need.
      
      
      The mountain trail leads NORTH, while the path continues SOUTH toward the forest.

    short_desc: Where grassland meets woodland
    long_desc: >
      Tall grasses give way to the edge of a pine forest. The trees stand like silent
      sentinels, their branches swaying gently overhead. Birdsong echoes through the
      canopy, and small woodland creatures dart between the undergrowth. A well-worn
      path leads into the woods.
      
      
      You're not alone in this world! Use WHO to see other players online. The CHAT
      command lets you speak to everyone: CHAT Hello everyone! You can also use
      WHISPER <name> <message> for private conversations, or GROUPCHAT if you're
      in a party.
      
      
      The foothills lie to the NORTH, and the forest path leads SOUTH.

    short_desc: A shaded forest path
    long_desc: >
      Dappled sunlight filters through the canopy as you walk the forest trail.
      The path is soft with fallen pine needles, muffling your footsteps. You notice
      animal tracks in the soft earth - some small, like rabbits, others larger and
      clawed. The underbrush rustles occasionally with unseen movement.
      
      
      Keep your eyes open! Creatures roam these lands. When you enter a room with
      creatures, they'll appear in the room description. Some are peaceful, while
      others may attack. Use CONSIDER <creature> to gauge how dangerous a foe might
      be before engaging.

    short_desc: A sunlit clearing
    long_desc: >
      You emerge into a peaceful clearing where wildflowers bloom among the grass.
      Butterflies dance on the warm breeze, and a fallen log provides a convenient
      seat. Wooden practice dummies stand at one edge of the clearing, bristling
      with old arrows and sword marks - a training ground for novice warriors.
      
      
      Combat is initiated with KILL <target> or ATTACK <target>. Once in combat,
      you'll automatically attack, but you can also use special abilities. If things
      go badly, try to FLEE! After combat, rest to recover your health. Type REST
      to begin resting, and WAKE when you're ready to continue.

      A crystal-clear stream cuts across the path here, burbling over smooth stones.
      Stepping stones provide an easy crossing, their surfaces worn smooth by years
      of use. Minnows dart through the shallows, and a kingfisher watches from a
      nearby branch.
      
      
      Almost there! Beyond this forest, the Starter Plains await. This is where you'll
      hone your combat skills against the creatures that roam the grasslands. When you're
      strong enough, you can make your way to the great city of Midgaard to the south.

      The forest thins and finally gives way to vast golden plains stretching to the
      horizon. The tall grass ripples in waves like a golden sea. To the south, you
      can see the grasslands extend in all directions - perfect hunting grounds for
      aspiring adventurers. Far in the distance, the walls of Midgaard rise against
      the southern sky.
      
      
      You've completed the tutorial path! The Starter Plains to the SOUTH are a 
      large open area where creatures roam freely. Explore, hunt, and grow stronger.
      When you're ready, head south through the plains to reach the city of Midgaard.

      A hawk circles lazily overhead, riding the thermal currents. Small game trails
      crisscross through the tall grass, worn by countless small creatures going about
      their daily business.

      watching from the battlements. Ahead, golden grasslands stretch in every
