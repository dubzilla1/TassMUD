      An old stone marker indicates this was once a trade route. Scattered around

      As an adventurer, you'll collect equipment and items. Type INVENTORY or INV to

      canopy, and small woodland creatures dart between the undergrowth. A well-worn
      path leads into the woods.

      animal tracks in the soft earth - some small, like rabbits, others larger and
      clawed. The underbrush rustles occasionally with unseen movement.
      
      
      Keep your eyes open! Creatures roam these lands. When you enter a room with

      Butterflies dance on the warm breeze, and a fallen log provides a convenient
      seat. Wooden practice dummies stand at one edge of the clearing, bristling
      with old arrows and sword marks - a training ground for novice warriors.
      
      
      Combat is initiated with KILL <target> or ATTACK <target>. Once in combat,
      you'll automatically attack, but you can also use special abilities. If things

      Almost there! Beyond this forest, the Starter Plains await. This is where you'll

    short_desc: Open grassland on the main road
    long_desc: >
      A well-worn road cuts through the grass here, running roughly north to south.
      This is the main trade route between the northern wilds and the city of
      Midgaard. Wagon ruts show regular traffic, and you spot a merchant's lost
      button glinting in the dirt.
      
      
      Follow this road south to reach the gates of Midgaard.

    short_desc: Rolling grassland with ant mounds
    long_desc: >
      Enormous ant mounds rise from the grass here, some taller than a human.
      The industrious insects march in endless columns, carrying bits of grass
      and unfortunate beetles to their underground chambers. It's best not to
      disturb them.

    short_desc: Scrubland at the plains' edge
    long_desc: >
      Scrubby bushes become more common as the plains transition toward rockier
      terrain. The vegetation provides cover for smaller creatures, and you can
      hear chittering and rustling all around. A well-used animal trail leads
      south toward the distant city walls.

    short_desc: Where plains meet marshland
    long_desc: >
      The ground becomes soft and boggy here as the plains give way to wetlands
      to the southwest. Cattails and reeds grow in standing water, and frogs
      chorus noisily. The footing is treacherous - best to head back north or
      east to firmer ground.

      You can see the walls of Midgaard clearly from here, rising above the
      grassland to the south. The road is nearby, and you occasionally spot
      travelers making their way to or from the city. Smoke rises from chimneys
      within the walls, and you can almost smell baking bread on the wind.

      The trade road widens here as it approaches the northern gates of Midgaard.
      The city walls loom impressively ahead, ancient stones weathered by centuries
      but still standing strong. Guards patrol the battlements, and you can hear
      the bustle of city life beyond the gates.
      
      
      The great city of Midgaard lies to the SOUTH. Return to the plains by
      heading NORTH.

      The eastern stretch of plains near Midgaard's walls. A few enterprising
      farmers have set up small plots here, growing vegetables to sell in the
      city markets. A scarecrow stands sentinel over a patch of cabbages, its
      button eyes staring blankly at the sky.

    long_desc: >
      The plains end here at a crossroads. The main road continues south to
      Midgaard's eastern gate, while another path leads east toward distant
      mountains and the unknown dangers beyond. Most travelers stick to the
      main roads - the wilderness holds many perils.
