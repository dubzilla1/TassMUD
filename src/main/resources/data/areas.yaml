# Area definitions for TassMUD
# Areas are logical groupings of rooms (zones)
#
# sector_type determines the base movement cost for traveling in this area:
#   INSIDE, CITY = 1 (indoor/urban - easy)
#   FIELD = 2 (open grassland)
#   FOREST = 3 (wooded terrain)
#   HILLS = 4 (rolling hills)
#   WATER_SWIM = 4 (shallow water)
#   SLUSH = 6 (muddy/slushy terrain)
#   MOUNTAIN, DESERT, SWAMP, UNDERWATER, SNOW = 8 (difficult terrain)
#   ICE = 10 (treacherous ice)
#   WATER_NOSWIM = 50 (deep water - requires boat/magic)
#
# Individual rooms can override the area's movement cost with their own move_cost.
