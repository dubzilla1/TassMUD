# Area definitions for TassMUD
# Areas are logical groupings of rooms (zones)
#
# sector_type determines the base movement cost for traveling in this area:
#   INSIDE, CITY = 1 (indoor/urban - easy)
#   FIELD = 2 (open grassland)
#   FOREST = 3 (wooded terrain)
#   HILLS = 4 (rolling hills)
#   WATER_SWIM = 4 (shallow water)
#   SLUSH = 6 (muddy/slushy terrain)
#   MOUNTAIN, DESERT, SWAMP, UNDERWATER, SNOW = 8 (difficult terrain)
#   ICE = 10 (treacherous ice)
#   WATER_NOSWIM = 50 (deep water - requires boat/magic)
#
# Individual rooms can override the area's movement cost with their own move_cost.

      The bustling heart of the city of Midgaard — cobbled streets,

    name: Plains of Danath
    description: >
      Rolling grasslands south of Midgaard, dotted with copses of trees,
      small ponds, and ancient standing stones. A peaceful but wild area
      where novice adventurers can test their mettle against the creatures
      that roam the open countryside.

    name: Western Highway
    description: >
      A broad westward thoroughfare that leaves Midgaard toward the open
      western lands. The highway is a primary route for trade and travel,
      with occasional campsites and road-side clearings. For now it serves
      as a conduit to several small roadside areas and future expansions.

    name: Midgaard Sewers
    description: >
      A dim, winding network of drains and maintenance tunnels beneath
      the city of Midgaard. The sewer passages are damp and maze-like,
      with standing pools, old masonry, and the echo of water in the dark.
      Dangerous vermin and strange things hide here; only the brave or the
      desperate travel through these passages.
